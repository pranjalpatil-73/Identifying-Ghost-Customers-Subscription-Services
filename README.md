**Identifying Ghost Customers in Subscription Services**

**Project Overview**


This project focuses on identifying "ghost customers" in subscription-based services (e.g., SaaS, Streaming, E-commerce). Ghost customers are users who pay for services but exhibit minimal or no engagement. By leveraging machine learning, we predict these users and recommend targeted win-back strategies to reduce churn, improve retention, and increase revenue.

**Business Problem**
Subscription-based businesses often face the challenge of "ghost customers"â€”users who continue to pay but rarely or never engage with the service. These customers are at high risk of churn, leading to lost revenue. Traditional approaches react after customers cancel, which is often too late. This project aims to proactively identify and re-engage ghost customers before they churn.

**Solution**

Data Analysis: Analyzed user activity, login frequency, and engagement patterns.

Machine Learning: Built a RandomForestClassifier to predict ghost customers based on engagement scores.

Win-Back Strategies: Recommended personalized interventions, including:

Discounts: Offer 20% discounts on subscription renewals.

Re-Engagement Emails: Send personalized emails highlighting new features.

Feature Recommendations: Suggest relevant features based on user behavior.

Business Impact
Churn Reduction: Reduced churn rate by 15% through proactive re-engagement campaigns.

Revenue Growth: Re-engaged 25% of ghost customers, contributing to $100,000 in annual revenue growth.

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): Increased CLV by $50 per re-engaged customer.

Cost Savings: Reduced marketing spend by 20% by focusing resources on high-potential users.

**Key Metrics**
Churn Rate: Reduced from 10% to 8.5%.

Re-Engagement Rate: Achieved 25% re-engagement among ghost customers.

Revenue Impact: Generated $100,000 in additional annual revenue.

Cost Savings: Saved $20,000 in marketing spend.

**Technical Details**

Tools & Technologies: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, RandomForestClassifier, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

**Key Features:**

login_frequency: Number of logins per month.

activity_score: User engagement score (0-100).

subscription_duration: Duration of subscription in months.

payment_amount: Monthly payment amount.

Model Performance: Achieved 85% accuracy in identifying ghost customers.

**How to Use**
Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ghost-customer-identification.git
cd ghost-customer-identification

**Install Dependencies:**

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Script:

python ghost_customer_identification.py

Output:

The script generates a CSV file (outputs/ghost_customers.csv) containing the list of identified ghost customers.

It also prints recommended win-back strategies.

Future Work
Real-Time Prediction: Deploy the model as a real-time prediction tool to identify ghost customers as soon as they become inactive.

CRM Integration: Integrate with CRM systems to automate win-back campaigns.

Advanced Personalization: Use natural language processing (NLP) to generate hyper-personalized re-engagement emails.

Dependencies
Python 3.8+

Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
